Ideally, reserve it for use upon especially powerful minions. For many players, when playing against a priest it is considered reasonable to assume that they will have at least one Mind Control in their deck. While this is not necessarily true, because of the power of Mind Control, players will often choose to expect its use, and alter their actions accordingly. Most importantly, this affects the summoning of extremely powerful minions, especially legendaries. For example, a player tempted to play Deathwing may choose not to if he is playing against a priest (unless the priest has already used 2 x Mind Control) due to the risk of the priest Mind-Controlling Deathwing and defeating the player. Even if the priest currently has no cards in their hand, experienced players can easily do the maths to predict the chance of the priest drawing it next turn, and swiftly defeating the player. For this reason, when playing against priests, very powerful minions can often become a burden, with the player not wanting to play them until they are certain that the priest cannot take control of it. Mind Control does not become available until late into the game. Players can use this knowledge to anticipate its use. Essentially, once round 8 has been reached, it is possible that the priest will use Mind Control at any time. Note that use of The Coin can allow its use on round 7. Some priests may be particularly likely to play Mind Control on round 8, due to their eagerness to make use of the card.

The basic strategy involves the hunter spending the early game fending off their opponent, while gathering low-cost beasts in their hand. Once they have several beasts and Unleash the Hounds, all of these cards can be played in a single turn. If the opposing player has no taunt minions, this can often allow the hunter to achieve a one-turn kill (OTK). Even if the hunter is not able to defeat their opponent that round, if they can gather sufficient low-cost beasts to achieve this combo, they can usually deal a very large amount of damage. Perhaps the most devastating way of using Unleash the Hounds is to use two Unleash the Hounds in the same turn. While the additional Charge will have no effect, the Attack buffs do stack. Hunters focusing on the use of this card generally fill their decks with a lot of low-cost beasts, focusing on the early-game. These hunters will usually play very few minions for the first few rounds, using spell cards to fend off attacks while slowly filling their hand. Once they've gathered enough beasts, and one or two UTHs, they will strike. The infamous element of this play is UTH's Charge effect, leaving no room for response or anything other than preemptive defence before the opponent is overwhelmed by a freshly-summoned group of beasts. This can make the spell unstoppable, and in many cases, results in players rushing to deal sufficient damage to the hunter to defeat them before they have time to put their combo into play. This card is best played when there are three of more of your beasts on the battlefield, or immediately after playing two or more beasts to give them charge. A good mini combo is to play Snake Trap and the turn after it triggers, play Unleash the Hounds.

However, its trade off effect will quickly outpace its low mana cost so try to get this minion off the board as soon as possible by either trading it with your opponents minions or using cards that remove it from play like Power Overwhelming. Alternatively you can Silence you own Minion to get rid off the effect before playing any other Minion. If you see your opponent playing this card, it's best to try to keep it on the field as long as possible to hinder your opponent's ability to play minions. But with its high attack, it's recommended to lower its damage first with spells like Humility", "lore": "", "cardid": "c00463"}

Characters who attack the Water Elemental during their own turn will only be frozen until the end of that turn, which is generally only of consequence for minions with Windfury.

This allows for some big hits opposing champion or clearing some of the larger minion targets on the board without having to take a turn to swing at something else first.
