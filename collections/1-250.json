This allows a rogue to tackle and potentially destroy a low-health minion each turn. This can allow the rogue to directly and very affordably remove low-level minions from the board during the early game, while still having enough mana to summon minions of their own. Unlike the druid's Shapeshift power, it only needs to be used once to gain two uses. The main downside with this power is the same as with any other weapon - attacking a minion using it will cause that minion to deal its damage to the rogue. This is a critical tactical choice for rogues. This power can allow them to maintain strong board control through the early game, but that control comes at the price of substantial self-inflicted damage. The rogue may choose to take the damage themselves in order to protect their minions, allowing them to build an imposing army; but if their health dips too low, or their army is suddenly removed with a well-timed Arcane Explosion, they may leave themselves open to a swift defeat. This is the only hero power that allows a hero to equip a weapon on demand. This weapon, while fairly weak, can be improved by effects such as Deadly Poison and Spiteful Smith's enrage to offer something far more powerful, and can be used with cards such as Southsea Deckhand and Bloodsail Raider. Unlike the druid's Shapeshift power, this power's effects do not expire at the end of the turn.

A mage must carefully consider which spells to include in their deck. While other spells do damage to more than one minion, or have secondary effects such as Freezing, or have restrictions, such as Ice Lance, Fireball has no secondary costs or effects, making it one of the most consistent spells in your arsenal. A deck including Fireball is very unlikely to include two copies of it and no copies of any other spell. For this reason, it's important to see what spells we want to pair Fireball with. Fireball, being a single-target spell, shares a similar spot in the deck to Pyroblast, Frostbolt and sometimes Ice Lance. Pyroblast is very expensive, so it's unlikely to want to deal with the same minions as you would with Fireball. Frostbolt deals 2 less damage and freezes for 1 less mana - which leaves Fireball as the better choice, unless you think that 6 damage is 'Overkill', or you are using spell damage minions to boost the power of Frostbolt to higher damage. Fireball does a large amount of damage to a single creature, which leaves us vulnerable as a mage to a large number of smaller creatures. A deck that includes Fireball should probably include some number of cards that help with smaller minions, such as Arcane Explosion, Blizzard, or Flamestrike. Lastly, Fireball can target your opponent. If you want to go a direct-damage route, it can be paired with Pyroblast for maximum damage.

Since Fireblast deals only a single point of damage, some strategy is needed to ensure that that point is applied where it is most effective. Fireblast can also be used as an effective way to enrage your own minions for only 1 damage. For example, use Fireblast on your Gurubashi Berserker to make it go from a 2/7 to a 5/6.

Ideally, reserve it for use upon especially powerful minions. For many players, when playing against a priest it is considered reasonable to assume that they will have at least one Mind Control in their deck. While this is not necessarily true, because of the power of Mind Control, players will often choose to expect its use, and alter their actions accordingly. Most importantly, this affects the summoning of extremely powerful minions, especially legendaries. For example, a player tempted to play Deathwing may choose not to if he is playing against a priest (unless the priest has already used 2 x Mind Control) due to the risk of the priest Mind-Controlling Deathwing and defeating the player. Even if the priest currently has no cards in their hand, experienced players can easily do the maths to predict the chance of the priest drawing it next turn, and swiftly defeating the player. For this reason, when playing against priests, very powerful minions can often become a burden, with the player not wanting to play them until they are certain that the priest cannot take control of it. Mind Control does not become available until late into the game. Players can use this knowledge to anticipate its use. Essentially, once round 8 has been reached, it is possible that the priest will use Mind Control at any time. Note that use of The Coin can allow its use on round 7. Some priests may be particularly likely to play Mind Control on round 8, due to their eagerness to make use of the card.

The basic strategy involves the hunter spending the early game fending off their opponent, while gathering low-cost beasts in their hand. Once they have several beasts and Unleash the Hounds, all of these cards can be played in a single turn. If the opposing player has no taunt minions, this can often allow the hunter to achieve a one-turn kill (OTK). Even if the hunter is not able to defeat their opponent that round, if they can gather sufficient low-cost beasts to achieve this combo, they can usually deal a very large amount of damage. Perhaps the most devastating way of using Unleash the Hounds is to use two Unleash the Hounds in the same turn. While the additional Charge will have no effect, the Attack buffs do stack. Hunters focusing on the use of this card generally fill their decks with a lot of low-cost beasts, focusing on the early-game. These hunters will usually play very few minions for the first few rounds, using spell cards to fend off attacks while slowly filling their hand. Once they've gathered enough beasts, and one or two UTHs, they will strike. The infamous element of this play is UTH's Charge effect, leaving no room for response or anything other than preemptive defence before the opponent is overwhelmed by a freshly-summoned group of beasts. This can make the spell unstoppable, and in many cases, results in players rushing to deal sufficient damage to the hunter to defeat them before they have time to put their combo into play. This card is best played when there are three of more of your beasts on the battlefield, or immediately after playing two or more beasts to give them charge. A good mini combo is to play Snake Trap and the turn after it triggers, play Unleash the Hounds.

In the early game, it can help to overcome a difficult card draw, or to allow you to place a high-cost minion on the field ahead of time. In the later game, it can be saved until an opportunity presents itself for The Coin's extra mana crystal to provide a substantial benefit. The Coin is a regular card, and counts towards your hand size, so you may want to keep it in your hand to use it with cards that counts towards your hand size, such as Twilight Drake.
